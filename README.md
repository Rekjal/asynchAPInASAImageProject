# Super Galactic Age Calculator
#### A web application that will take a person’s _Age_ in years, _Gender_, and _Demographic_ and return various attributes of Age relative to other planets. A TDD spec was committed _before_ writing associated method thus ensuring adherence to the _Red, Green, Refactor_ workflow. At least one test was created for each spec and no test had more than one expectation. Application returns the following ...
-  Age in `Mercury years`
-  Age in `Venus years`
-  Age in `Mars years`
-  Age in `Jupiter years`
-  How many `years a user has left to live` on each planet (including `Earth`). This is calculated based on user’s estimated `Life Expectancy` which in turn is calculated based on two pieces of information collected from user (`Gender`, and `Demographic`). This spawns 3 cases ..
	- If user has already surpassed the estimated `Life Expectancy`, return the number of `years user has lived past` the estimated `Life Expectancy`.
	- If user hasn't surpassed the estimated `Life Expectancy`, return the number of years `left to live`
	- If user's `current age` is `exactly equal` to estimated` Life Expectancy`, gently inform on `impending death`

> -   Your Age on  `Venus`  is  `72`  (Estimated `Life Expectancy`  based on  Gender/Demographic:  `104`. `Years left to live`:  `32`)
> -   Your Age on  `Earth`  is  `45`  (Estimated `Life Expectancy`  based on  Gender/Demographic:  `65`. `Years left to live`:  `20`)
> -   Your Age on  `Mars`  is  `23`  (Estimated `Life Expectancy`  based on  Gender/Demographic:  `34`. `Years left to live`:  `11`)
